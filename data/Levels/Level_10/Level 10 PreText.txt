H: Ah, Agent Goldsmith, welcomeâ€¦
P: Who are you? And how do you know me?
H: I am the CEO here at Wellness Corp.
H: We have been following you closely.
H: Do you think you are the first agent
H: to investigate us?
P: Perhaps not but I will be the last.
P: I will see you behind bars!
H: Ha, you think? Tell me, what have you been
H: doing with the data you have collected?
P: It's already uploaded to World Sec.
H: Perhaps, or perhaps we hacked your connection
H: And have blocked any automatic uploads.
P: Really? Well I can get around that, I will
P: use my Brain Jack, connect to the data 
P: and upload. Just try and stop that!
H: Good luck, but fair warning we have your 
H: device hacked and will be deleting your memory
H: We would not want you to get, ahem, deleted
H: now would we.
P: One question. If you know what I am doing
P: why not use more forceful methods 
P: to silence me?
H: We scanned you when you came in. You have 
H: LifeTags. Think we are stupid enough to
H: harm you here? No, we prefer to just
H: discredit your findings. 
P: You will not stop me, you will pay for this!
