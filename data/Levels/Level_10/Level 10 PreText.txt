H: Ah, Agent Goldsmith, welcomeâ€¦
P: Who are you? And how do you know me?
H: I am the CEO here at Wellness Corp. We have been following you closely. You are not the first investigate us.
P: Perhaps not but I will be the last. I will see you behind bars!
H: Ha, you think? Tell me, what have you been doing with the data you have collected?
P: It's already uploaded to World Sec.
H: Maybe it is, or maybe we hacked your connection and have blocked  any automatic uploads.
P: Really? Well I can get around that, I will use my Brain Jack, connect to the data and upload. Just try and stop that!
H: Good luck, but fair warning we have your device hacked and will be deleting your memory. 
H: We would not want you to get, ahem, deleted now would we.
P: One question. If you know what I am doing why not use more forceful methods to silence me?
H: We scanned you when you came in. You have LifeTags. Think we are stupid  enough to harm you here? 
H: No, we prefer more discrete methods.
P: You will not stop me, you will pay for this!
