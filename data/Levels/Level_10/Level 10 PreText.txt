H: Ah, Agent Goldsmith, welcomeâ€¦
P: Who are you? And how do 
P: you know me?
H: I am the CEO here at Wellness Corp.
H: We have been following you closely.
H: Do you think you are the first agent
H: to investigate us?
P: Perhaps not but I will be the last.
P: I will see you behind bars!
H: Ha, you think? Tell me, what have you been
H: doing with the data you have collected?
P: It's already uploaded to World Sec.
H: Perhaps, or perhaps we hacked your 
H: connection and have blocked 
H: any automatic uploads.
P: Really? Well I can get around that, I will
P: use my Brain Jack, connect to the data 
P: and upload. Just try and stop that!
H: Good luck, but fair warning we have your 
H: device hacked and will be deleting your 
H: memory. We would not want you to get, 
H: ahem, deleted now would we.
P: One question. If you know what I am doing
P: why not use more forceful methods 
P: to silence me?
H: We scanned you when you came in. 
H: You have LifeTags. Think we are stupid 
H: enough to harm you here? No, we prefer 
H: to just discredit your findings. 
P: You will not stop me, you will pay for this!
