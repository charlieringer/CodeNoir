Maintainience Report:
Server 4 was taken offline for 4 hours yesterday.
The cause appears to be a fly which got caught 
in one of the circuits and fried it. The problem
was debugged and the server brought back online.
No loss of data occurred as a result as the other
servers managed to handle the additional load.
